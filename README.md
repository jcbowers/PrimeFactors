# PrimeFactors-Node
A simple single page application (SPA) to demonstrate the prime factors kata using an MVC front-end Node.js back-end.

## Objective
This was a project started out as an opportunity for me practice the prime factors kata 
(http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata) using JavaScript, but evolved into a chance for me to explore 
technologies like Eclipse, Node.js, Mocha, Express, and Knockout.js.



## Usage
Simply navigate to your branch directory using the node console and enter $ node app.js.


## Developing
The basic architecture for this project is an SPA front end using JQuery and Knockout.js (http://knockoutjs.com) for ViewModel binding,
and an MVC back end using the express framework (http://expressjs.com) running on Node.js.

This project requires the Nodeeclipse plugin (http://www.nodeclipse.org) as well as Express and Mocha.
